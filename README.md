# engineering-portfolio

engineering-portfolio is a SPI (single page application) using React.  This project features json.server API fetch calls to populate data.  It also incorporates client-side routing. 

A demo video is available to walk you through the page: https://youtu.be/WaiYrl44OIA

engineering-portfolio consists of client side routes to the following:

HOME - a basic introduction to me as an engineer

ABOUT - a little more detail about my engineering background and a list of engineering skills

PROJECTS - A get request pulls a list of projects from json server API and displays them. Below is a button to toggle (show/hide) an "add a project" form.  The filling out and submitting the form will POST a new prject to the API server as well as display it on the project page.  To remove a project, there is an "x" button on the upper left side of each project card.  Clicking the "x" will delete the project from the page and remove it from the API.
